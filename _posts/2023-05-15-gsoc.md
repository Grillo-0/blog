Wow, it's really happening :D

After some [warm-up][warm-up] and work put on, I got accepted into the 2023
Google Summer of Code program with the X.Org organization.

# What I'm Going to Do

The title of my project is ***"Increasing Code Coverage on the DRM Code"***. The
[DRM subsystem][drm] is the standard way to interact with complex graphics
devices.

It provides many global helpers for use inside the drivers. As these helpers are
used by many drivers on the DRM subsystem, testing those functions for asserting
that no regressions are made is crucial for kernel development.

Many units test were written for those helpers with the [KUnit framework]
[kunit]. But there is still much work to do. Running the [Gcov code covering
analysis tool][gcov], we see that [just one file has 100% of code
coverage][coverage-report]. Knowing this, I will create more tests for the
`drm-format-helper.c`. This file handles color format conversion.

Currently, the conversion functions can't handle ***planar formats***. Instead
of having the color information packed in a single plane, those have their
information separated into multiple planes. I pretend to add support for it by
modifying the `drm_fb_xfrm()` function.

# My Mentors

This Summer, I will be mentored by:
- [Maíra Canal][maira]
- [André "Tony" Almeida][tony]
- [Tales L. Aparecida][tales]

# What I'm Doing Right Now

During this community bonding period, I'm reserving time to review patches on
the `dri-devel` mailing list and read more about the DRM.

These are my reviews:

- <https://lore.kernel.org/all/87fb8f63-ae38-33eb-08ef-7410b52b4f98@riseup.net/>
- <https://lore.kernel.org/all/ffee1587-5236-ce35-40b4-5b8286dd095b@riseup.net/>
- <https://lore.kernel.org/all/7ac2cfb2-3912-675a-3ba0-171caab3ba30@riseup.net/>
- <https://lore.kernel.org/all/bc601be4-14e3-14f3-8d14-baea399150e2@riseup.net/>

In parallel, I'm trying to add support for the NV12 format to the [VKMS
driver][vkms]. This would be nice for testing userspace programs that contain
framebuffers with video. This is turning out to be bigger than I thought, as I
need to add support for planar formats there and make the format conversion in
software. Stay tuned for blog posts on that too ;).

See ya! :)
